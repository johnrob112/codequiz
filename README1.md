# codequiz

For this weeks challenge I was tasked to make an interactive site, which prompts users with a series of questions and gives a score to them based on their answers and the time it takes to submit.  I had a very busy week, so I am a bit behind, so I am submitting what I have with intentions to submit a version worth grading over this weekend.  My apologies.  

Here is the link to the deployed site
